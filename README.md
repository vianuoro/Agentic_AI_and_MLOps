# 🧠 AutoML Agent for Real-Time Customer Support Ticket Triage

## ChatGPT reference


## 🚀 Objective
Build an **Agentic AI system** that autonomously retrains, tests, and deploys ML models to classify and prioritize incoming support tickets in real-time—integrated with an **MLOps pipeline** for CI/CD, monitoring, and model governance.

## 🧩 Components Overview

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Agentic AI | LangChain / CrewAI + OpenAI | Orchestrate autonomous agents to manage data cleaning, retraining, validation, and deployment |
| ML Models | Scikit-learn / HuggingFace Transformers | Model for ticket classification (urgency + topic) |
| Data Pipeline | Apache Airflow / Prefect | Schedule and automate data ingestion and preprocessing |
| Model Serving | FastAPI / BentoML | Expose model as a REST API |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions + MLflow | Automate training & deployment, track experiments |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana / EvidentlyAI | Track model drift, latency, and accuracy in prod |

## 🔁 System Workflow

### 1. **Ticket Ingestion**
- Source: Zendesk or simulated via synthetic ticket generator.
- Format: `{ "text": "Can't access my account...", "timestamp": "..." }`

### 2. **Agentic Task Orchestration**
Use **CrewAI** or **LangGraph** to define a team of autonomous agents:

- 🔹 `DataAgent`: Fetches and cleans new support ticket data.
- 🔹 `TrainingAgent`: Retrains model if drift detected or performance drops.
- 🔹 `EvalAgent`: Validates performance (cross-validation, benchmarks).
- 🔹 `DeploymentAgent`: Deploys new version via CI/CD triggers.
- 🔹 `MonitoringAgent`: Continuously checks production metrics.

### 3. **MLOps Pipeline**
- **Data versioning**: DVC or Delta Lake.
- **Model training**: Pipelines built with `sklearn` or HuggingFace `Trainer`.
- **Model registry**: MLflow for versioning and model metadata.
- **Model deployment**: Serve with FastAPI and Docker, integrated with CI.

### 4. **Monitoring and Feedback**
- Track:
  - Latency (Prometheus)
  - Accuracy and precision over time (EvidentlyAI)
  - Drift detection (feature distribution shifts)
- Trigger retraining agent if:
  - Drift > threshold
  - Accuracy < target

## 🎯 Bonus Ideas

- Add an LLM-based `SummarizationAgent` that creates summaries for long tickets.
- Use **AutoTrain** or **AutoSklearn** for agent-driven hyperparameter tuning.
- Connect with Slack or email for alerts from the MonitoringAgent.
